Shadowplay - 07022005

This is the first release of shadowplay. Right now it has two modes. The default is basically just a test mode to check the video. The second is the start of a falling sand demo. The particals don't collide yet, but they do stop moving when they hit a shadow.

To select which of the modes you want to use put a '-s' switch on the command line when you start it up.

The keyboard can have some control over the input and output.
'+'/'-': Changes the threshold for what is considered a shadow.
'i': Inverts the shadow buffer.
'v': Flips the background between the actual video and the shadow buffers.
'f': Outputs the fps on the console.
'c': For the default run mode this will display a spinning cube with the video displayed on all the faces.

To create a new toy just make a new subclass of GameController and overwrite the Draw method. Then just modify main.cpp and Makefile to compile the new class in and allow you to select it from the commandline.
