Shadowplay - 07022005

This is the first release of shadowplay. Right now it has two modes. The default is basically just a test mode to check the video. The second is the start of a falling sand demo. The particals don't collide yet, but they do stop moving when they hit a shadow.

To select which of the modes you want to use put a '-s' switch on the command line when you start it up.

The keyboard can have some control over the input and output.
'+'/'-': Changes the threshold for what is considered a shadow.
'i': Inverts the shadow buffer.
'v': Flips the background between the actual video and the shadow buffers.
'f': Outputs the fps on the console.
'c': For the default run mode this will display a spinning cube with the video displayed on all the faces.

To create a new toy just make a new subclass of GameController and overwrite the Draw method. Then just modify main.cpp and Makefile to compile the new class in and allow you to select it from the commandline.

Known problems:
- The first time I start the program up after a reboot the video is messed up. To work around this run a different TV program like tvtime.
- I've only ever run this on my machine which is a Athlon XP 1700+ running LFS with an AverMedia AverTV Studio tuner card (with a really old camera plugged into it for input). You might have to play around with compile options. The video input is basically a butchered version of the capture.c demonstration code for V4L.
